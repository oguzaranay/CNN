    "## Overview\n",
    "This tutorial presents DVNs, an energy-based model for structured prediction.\n",
    "DVN learn a value function, i.e. they estimate the performance of a solution __y__, w.r.t the ground-truth __y∗__,\n",
    "as a function of the input __x__ and the solution __y__. I.e, the goal of training is to get a value network _v_ for which\n",
    "\n",
    "_v_(__x__, __y__; __θ__) = v∗ (__y__, __y*__), (Eq. (5) in the paper)\n",
    "\n",
    "where v∗ is the true performance of __y__, given the ground truth __y∗__. In this example, we use F1 scores (Eq (7)  in the paper).\n",
    "Once the network is trained, as in this notebook, the network can predict the performance under absence of the ground truth __y∗__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictions are made by gradient ascent, w.r.t. __y__.\n",
    "Given some initial solution __y__, the network estimates the value of that solutions and then __y__ is updated, so that the estimated value increases.\n",
    "For more details, see the paper.\n",

    "## Contents of this tutorial\n",
    "In this we use a DVN that was already trained on the Bibtex dataset and analyze it's predictions.\n",
    "In particular we look at what value the DVN assigns to the ground truth and how it iteratively makes predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "This code works with python 2.7.\n",
    "Addionally, the notebook needs jupyter. Consult http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html on how to install it.\n",

    "Run\n",
    "```bash\n",
